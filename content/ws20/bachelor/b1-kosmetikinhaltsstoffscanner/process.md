We didn't know what kind of framework and programming language we should choose instantly.
Neither of us had any real experiences with app developing until the full end. So anything was
possible. After our decison for Flutter we split our team in three groups called UI, database
and text recognition and by learning and doing we managed to merge our group results into one raw
shell. Twice or once a week we met and discussed upcoming ideas and the toDo’s. Our vision was to
create an application for users who are very aware of their cosmetic consumption and we want to
support them with a quick check with our KISS-App. Especially for users who are allergic to certain
ingredients.

The whole installation process needed much more time as we expected. In the end some of us couldn’t use the entire 
app development tools. Neither the emulator was working nor the access to the device file explorer. As a consequence
half of the group had to switch their IDE which took time and nerves.

Text recognition team reported:
“We wanted to shorten the recognized text by the help of Regex. Learning Regex wasn’t easy going. As beginners we 
perceived Regex as not very intuitive, so it took a while to find the right expression to cut everything before ‚ingredients‘. “
